MVCASE requires JRE 5.0 to run.
To install, unzip files on some folder, and run 
mvcase.bat (windows users).
The mvcase.bat file refers to the java.exe program, 
which must be referenced by your PATH environment 
variable. If you do not want to change your PATH 
variable, change mvcase.bat to point directly to 
java.exe from your JRE 5.0.
